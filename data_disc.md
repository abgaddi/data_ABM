## Data Discovery


The appealing thing about ‘data science’ is that there is not just one approach. 
This is beneficial since every problem is different and can’t be solved the same way. 
Similarly, every country is built upon different values and cultures such that ‘human development’ will look different in each country.  
The Big Data for Development Report gives many examples of how diverse and how applicable data science methods can be for understanding human behavior.
In this essay, I will highlight the arguments made in the World Bank report in favor of big data and also talk about the caveats of using big data in human development.


On the surface level, the awareness and the use of big data allows for official statistics within a country acting as a basic measure of the population’s conditions.  
Knowing these numbers aids in a government’s policy decisions to deliver the needed services of its constituents.  
However, data science allows us to look more closely at specific human behavior.  
For example, we can predict seasonal or temporary migration patterns using cell phone data (p 26).  
Or look at the displacement of people from natural disasters and create evacuation plans based on this (p 26).  
Even looking at rain data and patterns allow an insight into food security or predict traffic flows that help with urban and road planning (p 26).[^1]


Using data from the internet especially social media has also enhanced our ability to predict and understand human behavior. 
Search queries can be used to show current events and conditions of an area; for example, search queries relating to jobs and the word ‘unemployment’ correlates with actual unemployment data (p 27).  
In addition, tweets can be used for real time tracking tool. 
In 2009, researchers used Twitter and several key words to look at people’s experiences and concerns during the H1N1 outbreak showing that this kind of information can help shape the responses of public health officials.[^2] 
This can even be translated into our current situation for COVID-19, and actually one of my classmates in another class is looking at whether the volume of tweets can be used in showing outbreaks before official counts have been updated.


Although there are so many possibilities of data science, there are also some draw backs that come with using data.  
The first and more obvious problem comes from the data itself.  
Creating a model is the easier part of data science, but the lack of data from the start is the hardest obstacle and more specifically clean data.  
And once data has been cleaned and imputed, there are too many different ways to store information, as I learned in a class that I took last semester (*Spatial Data Discovery*).  
There’s not one universal way of how researchers collect and label their data, and there are many ways of saving that information too. 
Data becomes useless when someone can’t understand what the numbers mean or have trouble even converting the file to use in their specific software.


The second dilemma that comes with using data is the ethical implication. 
A lot of people have concern over the privacy of personal information.  
This stems from the lack of transparency and awareness of what this data is being used for.  
Another ethical issue is bias of information leads to a biased machine.  
For example, some court judges use the COMPAS algorithm to predict the likelihood that a defendant will re-offend based on many variables. 
However, that information collected may be biased just based off of U.S. history and biased decisions. Now, that algorithm/machine may be biased not because it is intended to be, but because that is all it knows.  
And this leads to the question, is it right to let a machine decide something as important who to let out on bail? What about other decision making?[^3]

All in all, data science provides us with more understanding of human behavior at a more detailed level than basic census statistics can.  
However, there are still many limitations in doing so. 
Because of its limitations, data science should not be the only factor in making decisions for a human life.  
It should be looked at more as a  *tool* for understanding human behavior that can continue to improve for better accuracy.
