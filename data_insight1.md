### Deep Transfer Learning

In simple terms, transfer learning is a machine learning method where a one model is trained then transfers what it learns to another model, hence the name.
The idea is similar to how humans learn to do things like if you learn how to roller skate, then you can apply that knowledge on learning how to ice skate without completely starting from scratch.
An article written by Pan and Yang explain the mathematics and the probability/distribution involved with this method. [^1]

This method has been typically used with text corpuses and image data.
An example of this would be like using apple images as the training model and using it to classify images of another fruit such as oranges. 
This is one of the advantages of this method; it can be tested on different data than the training model as long as the 'purpose' or domain of the models are still the same.
Other advantages include reducing training time and performance cost.[^2]

In 2018, several students from Stanford University conducted two different studies using deep transfer learning on remote sensing data from satellites. 
One study was able to predict crop yield in Brazil using harvest data from Argentina.
Their findings would be beneficial to developing countries that need to rely on a crop prediction tool that is also inexpensive.[^3]
The other study looked at predicting infrastructure quality in Africa and used transfer learning on classifying the satellite images for types of infrastructure. 
Looking at the quality of infrastructure is important since it serves as an indicator for tracking qaulity of life in developing countries.[^4]
Both successes of these studies show that the use of transfer learning is applicable in human development.
This is also promising in helping organisations like the UN improve their Sustainable Development Goals since a limitation for their indicators is almost always the lack of recent and accurate data.
